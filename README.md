This project is currently in progress. Stay tuned for further updates.



HARDWARE REQUIRED :-
Raspberry pi 3 (Model B)
1 Motor Driver (L293D)
2 BO Motors (300 RPM)
3 Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04)
1 GPS Receiver & Antenna (Ublox Neo-M8N)
Powerbank (To powerup the Raspberry pi)
12V Power Source (To run the motors)
5.1K & 10K Resistors (To step down the 5v from US Sensor to 3.3V for Raspberry pi)
Chassis & Wheels
Breadboard & Dupont Wires


SOFTWARE USED :-
The entire code is written in Python3. However, any other language can also be used. Python is preferred beacause of the nativity with Raspberry pi 3.


Progress:-
The code isn't complete yet. Currently, Ultrasonic sensors have been interfaced with the pi and the GPS module has'nt been interfaced yet.
